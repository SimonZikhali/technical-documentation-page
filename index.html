         <h3>Introduction</h3>
       </header>
         <p> Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem.

          <h3>What you should know about programming</h3>
        </header>
          <p>
            As mentioned above, Computers understand instructions that are written in a specific syntactical form called a programming language. A programming language provides a way for a programmer to express a task so that it could be understood and executed by a computer.The languages are majorly used in web applications, System administration, games applications, and multimedia. It is used to create plugins and extensions for existing applications. Some of the popular scripting languages are: 
          </p>
        <li>Server Side Scripting Languages: Javascript, PHP, and PERL.</li>
        <li>Client-Side Scripting Languages: Javascript, AJAX, Jquery</li>
        <li>System Administration: Shell, PERL, Python</li>
        <li>Linux Interface: BASH</li>
        <li>Web Development: Ruby</li>

          <h3>JavaScript and Java</h3>
        </header>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive.<br>
   Java is one of the most popular programming languages used to create Web applications and platforms.<br>Both Java and JavaScript are written, assembled and executed differently, and each has dramatic differences when it comes to what it is capable of doing.There are some other key differences:
          </p>
        <li>JavaScript code is run on a browser only, while Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser.</li>
        <li>Java is an OOP (object-oriented programming) language, and JavaScript is specifically an OOP scripting language.</li>
        <li>Java code must be compiled, and JavaScript code is all-text.</li>
        <li>Each language requires different plug-ins.</li>

        <header>
          <h3>Hello world</h3>
        </header>
          <p>The "Hello world!" program is a simplest program that will display some text on the screen.<br>The "Hello world!"program is a simple yet complete program for beginners that illustres the basic syntax of any programming language.<br>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
   
     </p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
   greetMe("World");
   </code>

          <h3>Java</h3>
       </header>
          <p>Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language with several features that make it ideal for web-based development.Java is used to develop mobile apps, web apps, desktop apps, games and much more.
   
   </p>
             <code>public class MyClass {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
       System.out.println("Hello World");

          <h3>Python</h3>
       </header>
       <p>Python is an advanced programming language that is interpreted, object-oriented and built on flexible and robust semantics.</p>

        <header>
          <h3>C++</h3>
       </header>
       <p>C++ is a general purpose, object-oriented, middle-level programming language and is an extension of C language, which makes it possible to code C++ in a “C style”. In some situations, coding can be done in either format, making C++ an example of a hybrid language.
   
   </p>
       <code>#include <iostream>
   using namespace std;
   
   int main() {
     cout << "Hello World!";
     return 0;
   }</code>

        <header>
          <h3>PHP</h3>
       </header>
       <p>PHP is an open-source scripting language designed for creating dynamic web pages that effectively work with databases. It is also used as a general-purpose programming language.
   
   </p>
       <code><?php

       </header>
       <p>SQL is a database query language (not a development language) that allows for adding, accessing and managing content in a database. It is the language that allows programmers to perform the common acronym CRUD (Create; Read; Update; Delete) within a database.
